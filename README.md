Zaga Token
This Solidity project is a basic implementation of a custom ERC20 token named Zaga (ZAG). It showcases the fundamental 
functionalities of a token contract, including minting and burning tokens. The purpose of this project is to provide evidence
of my metacrafters task and it is also a starting point for developers looking to create their own ERC20 tokens on the
 Ethereum blockchain.

Description
This project is a token contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the 
Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functions for minting and burning tokens, as well as public variables that store 
the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply. This program serves as a simple introduction to token contract development
 and can be used as a foundation for more complex projects in the future.

Getting Started
Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at 
https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file 
with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol). Copy and paste the .sol code in this repo into the file:


To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set 
to "0.8.19" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand 
sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn functions. Click on the "MyToken" 
contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then use the appropriate function to manage the token supply.
